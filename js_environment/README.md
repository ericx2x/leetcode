This is a project that has some random interview questions that you might receive on in a javascript job opportunity. They're a great set of problems to learn from. Fun way to learn as well.

This project utilizes React's basic framework for a nice ES6 instance of JS as well as a front end environment to go with it. Useful features, etc.
