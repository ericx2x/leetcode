1.) Done in JS, Good runtime, Well understood. Summary - had to find two indices in an array that added to a target number. This was done with brute force, and then with a hash table*
2.) Not yet done, attempted in python because needed linked lists easily. Not well understood, Summary - have to work at this. march 1 2019- i now understand this better but still need to hone it down. I was not able to come up with a solution on my own but I now know how this data structure works. it's an object with two fields, one if a value the other is an object that points to another object. then that object has a value + another object that points... so on and so forth. But i need to actually write out the problem and console log things to udnerstand how the solution works.
